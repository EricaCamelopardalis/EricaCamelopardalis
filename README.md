<!-- Introduction -->
<h2>Me? Seriously?</h2>
<p>'Must you maneuver your gaze upon my small profile? Geez, you'll make me blush.</p>

<p>I'm a supersenior currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science at the University of Arkansas. Data is beautiful, and so is the labyrinthine cascade of relationships from schema to schema.</p>

- I currently have two roles I maintain: I've taught as a **Supplemental Instruction Leader** for three and a half years, and I'm also my department's **Data Analyst** since September 2025! I've recently begun embarking on an educational analytics internship, applying NLP-based analysis to qualitative survey data spanning from Fall 2019. It's super hard for me to not talk about data and education in the same sentence.
  
- More personally, shifty-shiny-sparkly things fancy my eye: I adore indie cosmetic brands! I've been into indie makeup and nail lacquer since I was a little kid, and I've recently taken new flame into a databasing project I began after I took a relational database course. I'm hand-collecting my own data for the database right now!-- I bought a macro lens! The backend for **NailDB** is done with a combination of PostgresSQL and Django/Django REST API, with the relational database schema in SQLdbm, and a UI concept in Figma!

- I'm finishing up my time in undergrad, and I'm currently working on a **customer attrition machine learning algorithm** in collaboration with a certain bank. It's not quite an internship-- it's a practicum that's part of our graduation requirements. We're nearing the end stages as I approach graduation, but I'm super proud of the work and effort I've invested into our results. I'm dying to talk about it, haha. 

- When I'm not working, you can often find me creating my own creative cosmetic looks. I genuinely enjoy the zen of creating looks-- so much so that I always wake an hour early to do one (and my, I'm awake once I'm done). You can find some of that work on my Instagram, but I really hope to expand my horizons into product photography as I master light better. Maybe by the time you're reading this, I've posted some interesting shots?
